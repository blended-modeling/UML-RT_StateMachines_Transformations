# RTSInfo sample model

The RTSInfo sample model shows how to read running model information, such as current capsule and capsule part names, and state names.

The RTSInfo sample model uses runtime API calls to get this information. This sample model uses RTS calls that may NOT BE AVAILABLE in all versions. For a complete list of these, please refer to the documentation for the Papyrus-RT version you are using.
