Pre-Condition: Robot ready to explore.

Check distance sensors
IF distance sensors detect wall THEN
	Determine closest wall
		{
			IF all sensors are analog THEN
				Select RoverSide facing closest wall
			ELSE
				FOREACH RoverSides
					Point best analog sensor towards RoverSide
					Keep smallest distance
				ENDFOR
				Select RoverSide facing closest wall
			ENDIF
			Turn rover towards closest wall
			Move forward until wall is found at minimal distance
			Mark start position
		}
	Explore
		{
			Turn rover left
			LOOP until DONE
				IF ( Encoder) 
					start counting encoder pulses
				Else
					Start timer
				ENDIF 
				LOOP WHILE
					(NOT ( wall is found at minimal distance OR
				  	wall on right moves beyond minimal distance OR
				  	current position == start position))
					{
						Move forward
					{
				ENDLOOP
				IF wall is found at minimal distance
					IF ( Encoder )
						convert pulse count into distance
					ELSE
						convert elapsed time into distance
				ENDIF
					Calculate new position from distance traveled
					Turn Rover Left
				Else IF wall on right moves beyond minimal distance THEN
					Turn Rover right
				ELSE
					DONE
				ENDIF
			ENDREPEAT
		}
	Check if inside wall
		{
			IF most turns were right turn, we followed an inside wall
				Mark map as inside wall
				Turn rover left
				Move forward until wall is found at minimal distance
				Mark outside wall start position
				DO Explore
			ELSE we need to look for inside walls
				Start inside wall search pattern (TBD)
			Endif
		}
